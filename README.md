# Emoshi

Elixir library for accessing emojis.

This library's list of emojis is generated from the official [emoji data set](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-test.txt)

## Installation

Add `emoshi` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:emoshi, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Basic usage

1. Searching an emoji by name
```elixir
iex> Emoshi.search("thumbs", take: 2)
[
  %Emoshi{
    slug: "thumbs-up",
    name: "thumbs up",
    status: :fully_qualified,
    emoji: "üëç",
    group: "People & Body",
    subgroup: "hand-fingers-closed"
  },
  %Emoshi{
    slug: "thumbs-down",
    name: "thumbs down",
    status: :fully_qualified,
    emoji: "üëé",
    group: "People & Body",
    subgroup: "hand-fingers-closed"
  }
]
```

2. Fuzzy search
```elixir
iex(1)> Emoshi.closest("tubms up", take: 1)
[
  %Emoshi{
    slug: "thumbs-up",
    name: "thumbs up",
    status: :fully_qualified,
    emoji: "üëç",
    group: "People & Body",
    subgroup: "hand-fingers-closed"
  }
]
```

3. Querying by group
```elixir
iex(2)> Emoshi.for_subgroups("Travel & Places", "hotel")
[
  %Emoshi{
    slug: "bellhop-bell",
    name: "bellhop bell",
    status: :fully_qualified,
    emoji: "üõéÔ∏è",
    group: "Travel & Places",
    subgroup: "hotel"
  },
  %Emoshi{
    slug: "luggage",
    name: "luggage",
    status: :fully_qualified,
    emoji: "üß≥",
    group: "Travel & Places",
    subgroup: "hotel"
  }
]
```

## Design and contributing
The main goal of this library is to provide the parsed emoji dataset as an Elixir package.

The approach of including the raw data set (either as text, json, or any format) and parsing it during runtime or during module compilation brings unnecessary dependencies and slows down application startup or application compilation times. This package aims to be as light as possible and currently contains no dependencies for production usage.
